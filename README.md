# Lending Club Issued Loans Analysis
# Introduction:

Lending Club, a prominent peer-to-peer lending platform, has revolutionized the way individuals and small businesses secure loans. By connecting borrowers directly with investors, Lending Club eliminates traditional banking intermediaries, offering a more streamlined and often more affordable borrowing process. Analyzing the loans issued by Lending Club provides valuable insights into the lending trends, borrower demographics, loan performance, and risk factors associated with peer-to-peer lending.

This analysis involves examining a variety of loan attributes such as loan amount, interest rates, loan grades, borrower credit scores, and repayment status. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, we can uncover patterns and correlations that inform better lending decisions, enhance risk management strategies, and ultimately contribute to the efficiency and reliability of the lending marketplace. Understanding these dynamics not only benefits investors seeking to maximize their returns but also supports borrowers in obtaining fair and transparent loan terms

# Define Problem / Problem Understanding
# Specify the business problem
The specific business problem revolves around the inadequacy of the current lending strategy, which is not sufficiently informed by comprehensive insights derived from Lending Club loan data. The institution struggles to assess borrower behaviour and market dynamics effectively, resulting in challenges such as inaccurate risk identification, difficulties in predicting loan default rates, and the inability to dynamically adjust lending criteria to respond to evolving market conditions.

# Business requirements
The business requirements involve the establishment of a robust data analytics framework that can extract meaningful insights from Lending Club issued loans data. This framework should enable the financial institution to gain a deep understanding of borrower behaviour, identify high-risk segments, predict default rates accurately, and provide the necessary foundation for real-time adjustments to lending criteria. Additionally, the solution should be scalable, adaptable, and capable of integrating with existing systems to ensure seamless implementation.

# 1. Growth and Impact of Peer-to-Peer Lending:
Studies such as "The Evolution of Peer-to-Peer Lending" by Emekter et al. (2015) and "P2P Lending: An Empirical Study" by Lin et al. (2017) provide a foundational understanding of the rapid growth of peer-to-peer lending platforms. These studies highlight how P2P lending offers competitive interest rates and ease of access, transforming the traditional lending landscape.
 
# 2. Risk Assessment and Credit Scoring Models:
Research by Serrano-Cinca et al. (2015) in "Risk of Default in P2P Lending" emphasizes the importance of advanced credit scoring models. These models integrate borrower credit history, loan characteristics, and socio-economic factors to predict default risks more accurately than traditional methods.
 
# 3. Machine Learning in Predicting Loan Defaults:
Studies like "Predicting Default in P2P Lending: An Application of Deep Learning Techniques" by Malekipirbazari and Aksakalli (2015) demonstrate the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predicting loan defaults. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks are explored to enhance predictive accuracy.

# Data Collection & Extraction From Database

# Project Demonstration & Documentation
# Story
A data story is a way of presenting data and analysis in a narrative format, with the goal of making the information more engaging and easier to understand. A data story typically includes a clear introduction that sets the stage and explains the context for the data, a body that presents the data and analysis in a logical and systematic way, and a conclusion that summarizes the key findings and highlights their implications. Data stories can be told using a variety of mediums, such as reports, presentations, interactive visualizations, and videos.
